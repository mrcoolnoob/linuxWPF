## Creating SO File

In Linux, the equivalent of a Windows DLL is a shared object file (SO), often referred to as a shared object (SO) or shared library. The extension for a shared object file is typically .so.

To use a C++ project in a C# project on Linux, you'll need to compile the C++ code into a shared object file using a GNU C++ compiler (such as GCC or Clang). The steps involved are as follows:

Write your C++ code: Create or modify your existing C++ code that you want to use in your C# project.

Compile the C++ code into a shared object file: Use the GNU C++ compiler to compile your C++ code into a shared object file. The command to compile the code might look something like this:

```sh
g++ -shared -o yourlibrary.so yourcode.cpp
```

This command will compile your C++ code (yourcode.cpp) into a shared object file named yourlibrary.so. Make sure to include any necessary compilation flags, such as -fPIC for position-independent code, if required.

Add the shared object file to your C# project: In your C# project, add a reference to the shared object file (yourlibrary.so). You can usually do this by right-clicking on the project in JetBrains Rider, selecting "Add" â†’ "Existing Item," and choosing the shared object file.

Import the functions from the shared object file in your C# code: Similar to using a DLL, you need to import the functions from the shared object file in your C# code. However, the import mechanism differs on Linux. The most common method is using P/Invoke (Platform Invocation Services), which allows you to call native functions from managed code. You'll need to declare the imported functions and specify the path to the shared object file using the DllImport attribute.

Use the functions from the shared object file in your C# code: Once you've imported the functions, you can use them in your C# code.

Build and run your C# project: Build and run your C# project to test the integration with the shared object file.

It's important to note that the compatibility between the C++ shared object file and your C# project depends on the target platform, architecture, and any dependencies. Make sure to compile the shared object file with the appropriate compiler options and handle any necessary data conversions or interop considerations between C++ and C#.

Also, keep in mind that the steps provided here are a general guideline, and the specific implementation details may vary depending on your project and tooling.

## Using SO File Functions

To import functions from a shared object file (.so) into your C# code using P/Invoke and the DllImport attribute, you need to follow these steps:

Determine the function signatures: Identify the functions from the shared object file that you want to use in your C# code. Note their names, return types, and parameter types. You'll need this information to declare the imported functions in C# correctly.

Declare the imported functions in C#: In your C# code, declare the imported functions using the DllImport attribute. This attribute informs the runtime how to locate and invoke the native functions. Here's an example of declaring an imported function:

```sh
[DllImport("yourlibrary.so")]
public static extern int YourFunctionName(int param1, string param2);
```

Replace "yourlibrary.so" with the actual path or name of your shared object file, and YourFunctionName with the name of the function you want to import. Adjust the return type and parameter types according to the function signature in the shared object file.

Use the imported functions in your C# code: Once you've declared the imported functions, you can use them in your C# code as if they were regular C# methods. Call them as needed and handle the return values and parameters appropriately.

Build and run your C# project: Build your C# project, ensuring that the shared object file is included in the output directory. Run your C# application to test the integration with the functions from the shared object file.


Remember to handle any necessary data conversions or interop considerations between C++ and C# when using the imported functions.

Additionally, make sure that the shared object file (yourlibrary.so) is accessible in the runtime environment. The file should either be placed in the same directory as the executable or be available in the system library search path.

Note: The above steps assume you're using P/Invoke for interop between C++ and C#. Alternative approaches, such as C++/CLI, may be used depending on your project requirements and tooling.
